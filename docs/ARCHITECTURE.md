```

**Layering** (imports point downward only, module-level):
`ui` → `service` → `generation` → `llm` → `core`, with `exports` and
`preview` as leaves used by `ui`/`generation`. `llm/providers` reaches
into `generation/codegen+prompts` for response extraction — a
deliberate exception with no module-level cycle.

A test (`tests/test_studio.py`) enforces that no `jarabe` (Sugar
shell) module is ever imported: the studio depends on the Sugar
*toolkit* only.

## How generated code is accepted

Provider code passes through three gates before a learner sees it:

1. **Static validation** (`validator.py`) — structure, safety, and
   request-specific quality checks. Errors reject the attempt;
   warnings ride along as "Also consider" hints on retries.
2. **Runtime gate** (`runtime_check.py` + `runtime_harness.py`) —
   the candidate actually runs in an isolated, minimal-environment GTK
   subprocess on the
   preview stubs: start, pump events, Journal write/read round-trip.
   Crashes, degraded startup, or a blocking `__init__` become retry
   feedback for the model. Skipped without a display;
   `AOD_RUNTIME_CHECK=off` disables, `AOD_RUNTIME_CHECK_TIMEOUT`
   tunes the limit (default 25 s).
3. **Critic round** (`critic.py`) — the model reviews its own
   accepted code once against a checklist (wired handlers, reachable
   win logic, real Journal state) and replies `OK` or minimal
   SEARCH/REPLACE fixes. Patched code must re-pass gates 1 and 2 or
   the original is kept. `AOD_CRITIC=off` disables.

Outcomes are recorded in the saved plan under `runtime_check` and
`critic`.

Rejected code is never replaced by another complete generation. After the
one initial `activity.py` response, `repair_loop.py` asks for exact,
uniquely-anchored SEARCH/REPLACE patches. Each proposal is applied
transactionally, checked from the static gate onward, and either committed or
rolled back. Cycles, `FULLREGEN`, ambiguous anchors, complete-file patches,
and credential-bearing responses are refused. Repair events and source hashes
are persisted on the job and in `aod_plan.json`; the per-run repair budget is
controlled by `AOD_CODE_REPAIR_ATTEMPT_LIMIT` (default 8). Exhaustion fails
with the best candidate preserved rather than regenerating it.

Before candidate execution, the runtime gate probes GTK/Sugar independently.
An unusable X11/Wayland environment is classified as unavailable
infrastructure and recorded as `runtime_unverified`, so it cannot become bogus
repair feedback or be mistaken for a completed runtime check.

The activity's icon comes from the model too (`icons.py`): one
`generate_text` call returns a 55x55 SVG on Sugar's color entities,
strictly sanitized (no scripts, images, text, gradients, or external
references; the canonical entity header is re-applied).  Anything
doubtful falls back to the deterministic template/category glyph.
`AOD_AI_ICON=off` disables; the outcome is recorded under
`icon_source`.

## Correspondence with the Sugar shell fork

The same experience runs embedded in the
[Sugar fork](https://github.com/Ashutoshx7/sugar) (`aod-activity-on-demand`
branch), which keeps flat module names. When porting changes between
the two:
